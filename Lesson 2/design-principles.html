            <p>The reason I selected this site is because they are able to effectivly pur most of their content
                from the pc view into the mobile version of their site. I also saw that their visual hierarchy is very clear, with deals and coupons being 
                at the top and the largest so as to draw people into purchasing their product. The next largest item is a section that directs you to starting your order.
                The next largest elements are auxillary functions of the site that either work in tandem with your order (tracker), 
                provide convienece (locations and coupons), or facilitate ordering (menue).

                While looking at this site, I noticed that every element was contained in a section. Each of these sections were 
                aligned with one another perfectly. Upon further inspection, I saw that elements such as buttons and images were all 
                aligned with other like elements across the page.

                <p>
            The amazon site provides a comfortable amout of white space (though that space is not neccesarily the color white.).
            When looking over this site, I saw a lot of content, but i was never bothered by the ammount There was
            enough space to comfortably fit every element and and distinguish between each elements space.
